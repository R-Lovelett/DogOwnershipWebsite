# What I Learned
This website was a cumulation of the things that I learned in a class dedicated to teaching the groundwork ideas for using
HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We were tasked to expand on a project we had already worked on, displaying the use of specific
coding elements at the same time.

I learned to:
- Implement HTML elements, including:
  - Headers
  - Paragraphs
  - Background Images
  - Lists
  - And a lot more!
- Reference CSS both inline and in a seperate stylesheet
- Use JQuery/Javascript to implement interactive components such as:
  - Radio Buttons
  - Text Fields
  - Fade out text fields
